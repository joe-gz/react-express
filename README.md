# React Express Starter

## Installation and startup

* `npm install`

At the moment, for development purposes I have the backend and from end running separately. Therefore, you have to run both of the following.

* for front end: `npm start`
  * go to localhost:3000
* for back end: `node server.js`
  * go to localhost:3001

** Check the other branches too **

* redux - react/express/redux
* sql - react/express/sql
* mongo - react/express/mongo
* react-router - react/react-router/express
